	<p>Your ability to think and speak in your mother tongue is a powerful gift.  You could make an eternal difference by bringing God's Word into your own language through participating as a Scripture reviewer.  The translation team will assign you specific verses to review along with a list of questions to determine how clear and accurate the translation.  You can comment on text, answer questions, and follow up on other comments.  What are you waiting for?  <a href="/signup">Sign up today!</a></p>

		Ways to Help Improve the Translation
	</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>It would be helpful, when there are real pertinent issues regarding differences in text, translation or exegetical choice, that you clearly refer to any other translation you are using in your comparison with the <i>Jamiekan</i> text.</li>
		<li>Read or hear the passage in its entirety and afterwards comment on the standard and specific questions.</li>
		<li>You can select which verses to comment upon or to make general comments on the whole text or part of the text.</li>
		<li>Try to make your comments as brief and clear as possible. If somebody else has already expressed your thoughts/sentiments just “agree/like/handfive/fistpound” their comment.</li>
		<li>Feel free to use <i>Jamiekan</i> or <i>English</i>. Do not worry about spelling in either one of these languages; we are more interested in your feedback then in your spelling skills, at this stage.</li>
		<li>Please, if at all possible, read the passage out loud first or hear the recording before commenting on the questions.</li>
		<li>Please, help us by providing arguments for your position, if at all possible. However, we are also interested in any “gut feelings” you might have something is not good, sounds weird, doesn’t feel right, even though you cannot explain why.</li>
		<li>If you are working in a group feel free to reflect shortly what the different opinions in the group are. Where possible, the translation team is interested in knowing what the weight was of opinions behind different options in the group discussions (“e.g. 40% were against this proposal, the rest agreed with me”).</li>
		<li>You do not have to answer all of the questions or answer all of the questions for each verse. Feel free to choose what is more striking to you.</li>
		<li>Feel free to give translation examples in <i>Jamiekan</i> that you think could improve the text.</li>
		<li>Feel free to respond to a comment or answer from somebody else on the site, either by agreeing with that person or actually commenting on another comment as part of an ongoing conversation.</li>
		<li>Please, help the translation team by stating, if you or the group think an expression is only used by people in certain groups or at certain time frames or in different social situations
		    (young vs old, countryside vs Kingston, man on the street vs educated people, men vs women, Jamaicans living abroad vs Island Jamaicans, Christians vs non Christians, this or that church community vs another church community, sport events, vs church events, showing respect vs not showing respect, etc. etc. ). </li>
