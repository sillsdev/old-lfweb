	<h2>How it Works</h2>
	<p>First, the team of trained translators meets with Jamaicans from various church denominations, universities and professions (pastors, teachers, and others). Together you talk about the Psalms chapters to be translated. Next, based on your help, the translation team produces a first draft and they post it on this website. Then you and everyone who has created a user account on the website can log-in and read or listen to the newly translated passages. Here you can ask questions, make comments, and suggest improvements. You can even comment on other people's comments, tooâ€” just like Facebook! The translators will interact with you on the website, and together the translation draft is improved. This cycle continues until the translated chapters are finished and immediately distributed to the community. In the end, the translation is the fruit of your combined voluntary efforts.</p>
